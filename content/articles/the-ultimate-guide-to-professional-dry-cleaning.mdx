Welcome to our comprehensive guide on professional dry cleaning. Choosing the right care for your clothing is essential to maintaining its quality, color, and fit over time.

## Why Dry Cleaning?

Dry cleaning isn't just about removing stains; it's a specialized process that uses advanced solvents to clean fabrics that cannot withstand water and traditional detergent.

1. **Gentle on Fabrics:** Water can cause fibers like wool and silk to shrink, distort, and lose their vibrant colors.
2. **Effective Stain Removal:** Our customized solvents dissolve oils and stubborn grease stains that water simply cannot touch.
3. **Professional Finishing:** Every garment is expertly pressed to restore its original shape, giving you that crisp, "like-new" look.

### Expert Attention to Detail

When you drop off your items at Al Adil Laundry, we don't just toss them into a machine. Every piece goes through a rigorous inspection process:

- **Pre-Spotting:** We identify and treat individual stains *before* the main cleaning process.
- **Cleaning:** The garments are cycled through our state-of-the-art closed-loop dry cleaning machines.
- **Post-Inspection & Pressing:** After cleaning, the items are checked again, perfectly steamed, and hand-pressed.

## What Should You Dry Clean?

While everyday cotton t-shirts and jeans are perfectly fine in the wash & fold service, you should strictly reserve dry cleaning for:

- **Suits and Blazers:** Always. The inner linings and structure will be ruined by water.
- **Silk Blouses and Dresses:** Silk is extremely delicate and prone to water spots.
- **Wool and Cashmere Sweaters:** To prevent the fibers from matting and shrinking.
- **Garments with Embellishments:** Sequins, beads, and complex designs require gentle solvent cleaning.
- **Heavy Curtains and Drapery:** Professional care ensures they retain their shape and deep coloring.

> **Pro Tip:** Always read the care label on your garments. If it says "Dry Clean Only", believe it! Ignoring this label is the fastest way to ruin a favorite piece of clothing.
